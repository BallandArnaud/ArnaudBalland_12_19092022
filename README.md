To switch the data to Mock or to API you can in `/src/utils/context/index.jsx` modify ans select `source.api` or `source.mock`.

```react
<SourceContext.Provider value={{ source: source.api }}>

Only id 12 and 18 work.

For example if you want to visualize the data of the user whose id is 12 go to :
`http://localhost:3001/user/12`
